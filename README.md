## Development and Contribution ##

We'd like develop a comprehensive platform which would make web development easier and quicker. At this point, some of the functionality that's provided is written using _very_ simple code which would probably cause an error if used incorrectly. We hope to improve this as we go along, and any help with this would be greatly appreciated.
